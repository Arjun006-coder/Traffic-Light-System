- âœ… Created `hooks/useStats.ts` - Daily statistics
- âœ… Created `hooks/useDebounce.ts` - Performance optimization

### 5. Main Page
- âœ… Created `app/page.tsx` - Main dashboard layout with 60/40 split

### 6. Supabase Integration
- âœ… Already have `lib/supabase.ts` with proper setup

## What Remains to Be Done ðŸ”¨

### High Priority: 3D Scene Components

1. **`components/scene/TrafficLight.tsx`** - 3D traffic light with glowing colors
   - Create three cylinders for red/yellow/green lights
   - Animate emissive intensity based on current color
   - Add pole and housing

2. **`components/scene/Vehicle.tsx`** - 3D vehicle boxes
   - Create colored boxes for different vehicle types
   - Add smooth lerp movement animation
   - Special glowing effect for emergency vehicles

3. **`components/scene/RoadMarkings.tsx`** - Lane lines and markings
   - Create dashed center lines
   - Add crosswalk markings
   - Position along roads

4. **`components/scene/Intersection.tsx`** - Single intersection with roads
   - Create intersection platform
   - Add 4 roads extending from center
   - Place traffic lights at each corner
   - Render vehicles in queues based on detection data

5. **`components/dashboard/TrafficScene3D.tsx`** - Main 3D container
   - Setup Canvas with Three.js/React Three Fiber
   - Add OrbitControls for camera
   - Setup lighting (ambient, directional, point lights)
   - Render two Intersections with connecting road
   - Add Grid for reference

## How to Complete the 3D Scene

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Start with TrafficLight.tsx** - Simplest 3D component
   ```tsx
   - Use useFrame for smooth color transitions
   - Use meshStandardMaterial with emissive property
   - Three cylinders stacked vertically
   ```

2. **Create Vehicle.tsx** - Animated vehicle boxes
   ```tsx
   - Simple box geometry
   - Color based on type (car=blue, bus=yellow, etc.)
   - Lerp movement using useFrame
   - Memoize to prevent re-renders
   ```

3. **Build RoadMarkings.tsx** - Simple lines
   ```tsx
   - Array of meshes with box geometry
   - White material
   - Position along lanes
   ```

4. **Build Intersection.tsx** - Complex component
   ```tsx
   - Multiple road meshes
   - 4 TrafficLight components
   - Map vehicle data to Vehicle components
   - Calculate queue positions
   ```

5. **Complete TrafficScene3D.tsx** - Main scene
   ```tsx
   - Canvas setup
   - Camera controls
   - Lighting
   - Two Intersection components
   - Connecting road
   ```

## Testing the Dashboard

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Create `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### 2. Run Development Server

```bash
cd WebDashboard/traffic-dashboard
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test with Sample Data

Insert test data in Supabase:

```sql
-- Test vehicle detection
INSERT INTO vehicle_detections (intersection, lane, cars, bikes, buses, trucks) 
VALUES ('int1', 'north', 5, 2, 1, 0);

-- Test light status
INSERT INTO light_status (intersection, lane, color, duration, reason)
VALUES ('int1', 'north', 'green', 45, 'High traffic detected');

-- Test emergency
INSERT INTO emergency_events (type, intersection, lane, distance, status)
VALUES ('ambulance', 'int1', 'north', 50.0, 'active');
```

### 4. Verify Real-time Updates

Watch the dashboard update automatically within 1 second when you insert new data!

## Expected Features

Once complete, the dashboard will have:

âœ… **Real-time Updates** - Supabase subscriptions update UI instantly  
âœ… **3D Visualization** - Isometric view of two intersections  
âœ… **Animated Statistics** - Numbers count up smoothly  
âœ… **Traffic Light Status** - 8 lanes with countdown timers  
âœ… **Decision Logic Display** - Shows algorithm reasoning  
âœ… **Emergency Alerts** - Red pulsing banner at top  
âœ… **Traffic Flow Graph** - Last 60 seconds of data  
âœ… **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile and desktop  
âœ… **Dark Theme** - Professional traffic control center aesthetic  

---

## Performance Optimizations

- Use `React.memo` for Vehicle components
- Debounce data updates in hooks
- Limit visible vehicles to 10 per lane
- Lazy load 3D scene (already done with dynamic import)
- Optimize Three.js renders with proper material settings

---

## Known Issues to Fix

1. Some files may have minor syntax errors - run linter to check
2. 3D scene components need to be implemented
3. Need to test with actual Supabase database
4. May need to adjust camera positioning for best view

## Next: Implement 3D Scene Components

Start with the simplest component (TrafficLight) and work up to the most complex (Intersection).
